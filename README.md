IoT based solution for control the temperature and make delivery of temperature sensitive perishable products more efficient.
The project proposes a solution for this problem using Internet of Things to control the temperature and make delivery of temperature sensitive perishable products more efficient. The device with Wi-Fi connection will have a unique ID so as to recognize which vehicle is it and what the vehicle is carrying. A temperature sensor will be used to monitor the temperature of the perishable product periodically and will be sent to Artik Cloud using 2G/3G Wi-Fi Routers (based on 2G/3G GSM Sim card and with Battery) along with the unique ID, GPS co-ordinates and battery level. So that the temperature and position of each delivery vehicle can be monitored in real time remotely through a pc / smartphone / tablet. In the absence Wi-Fi signal (ie. Absence of 2G or 3G coverage), all data values are stored in memory and transmitted as soon as coverage resumes. RTC is also connected for logging time-based record of the temperatures experienced. In this project the device use sleep mode, so that it "sleeps", "awakes", updates its position and temperature, and "sleeps" again. The optimum time between samples (which will be different for different products) to properly balance the binomial energy consumption with precision.
